# DJ Controller

### Description:
Fully functional audio player, that gives the users the ability to control two songs at the same time. The project covers both software and hardware environment. At the base sits a multifunctional audio player, which can be connected to an Arduino controller and take the input from potentiometers and use it to manage the functions of the player.

### Technologies:
- Python3
- Arduino

### Management:
- Branching Strategy -> [GitHub Flow](https://githubflow.github.io/)
- Kanban -> [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/besenhimself/audioMixer/projects/1)
- Mandatory Code Reviews

### First Milestone:

1. Technology Research
    - How to connect Arduino with Python
    - How to take the input from Arduino
    - How to program the input taken
    - How to program an audio player

### Second Milestone:
1. Programming an audio player
   - Using a song as an input
   - Basic functions of an audio player: play, pause, skip, replay
2. Advanced audio player functions
   - Being able to multitask between two songs
   - Adding advanced functions to the audio player: volume up/down, speed etc

### Final Milestone:
1. Hardware
    - Connections and soldiering between the potentiometers, lcd display, sliders etc. and the controller
    - LCD display showing the controls
    - Custom plastic box to fit the hardware and make a presentable DJ controller
2. Connect Arduino with Python
    - Be able to control the audio player via Arduino controller

### Optional:
1. A good looking audio player UI
