<h1>DJ Controller</h1>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>
Fully functional audio player, that gives the users the ability to control two songs at the same time.
The project covers both software and hardware environment.
At the base sits a multifunctional audio player, which can be connected to an Arduino controller and take the input from potentiometers and use it to manage the functions of the player.
