# DJCON

### Description:
DJCON is an **open-source software** and **hardware** project for Linux PCs. You can either use our audio player that can **play up to two songs** at once and control them or follow the complete guide and create yourself the **DIY** music controller with **potentiometers**, **Arduino** and an optional **LCD**.

### Technologies:
- Python3
- Arduino1.8

### Management:
- Branching Strategy -> [GitHub Flow](https://githubflow.github.io/)
- Kanban -> [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/besenhimself/audioMixer/projects/1)
- Mandatory Code Reviews
- Regularly updating the [Wiki](https://github.com/krispetrov/dj-controller/wiki)

### First Milestone:
#### Research
1. Technology Research
    - How to connect Arduino with Python
    - How to take the input from Arduino
    - How to program the input taken
    - How to program an audio player

### Second Milestone:
1. Programming an audio player
   - Using a song as an input
   - Basic functions of an audio player: play, pause, skip, replay
2. Advanced audio player functions
    - Use two songs at the same time
    - Being able to multitask between two songs
    - Adding advanced functions to the audio player: volume up/down, speed etc.
3. Arduino code
    - Taking input from multiple potentiometers
    - Creating the logic of the code
    - Programming the LCD to show volume changes

### Final Milestone:
1. Hardware
    - Connections between the hardware
    - Hardware soldiering
    - Presentable case that can fit all the parts
2. Arduino with Python
    - Connect the Arduino with the Python code
    - Read the values of the potentiomeres
    - Use the values to control the audio player

### Optional:
1. A good looking audio player UI
